## *Story*
    The protaganist wakes up in a pyramid with no memory of their past nor who they are, only an amulet with the Eye of Horus and a torch in their possession. They have to find their way out of the pyramid in order to regain their memories. One ending concludes with the protaganist finding out that they were a retainer for a pharoah. Another ending is the protaganist remembering that they were a treaure hunter after they successfully escaped past the elite pyramid guards and advanced booby traps with the pharaoh's ultimate treasure sealed away at the top floor of the pyramid. The last ending is where the protaganist finds their own large burial in the pyramid and realizes that they were the pharoah of the lost civilization they were buried with. It is up to the player to decide which ending they perceive to be the true ending.
## *Setting*
    Long, long ago in the fantasy land of Zetar, there existed the ancient civilization of [civilization_name]. The [civilization_name] people practiced a polytheistic religion, worshipping the gods of the desert in hopes of receiving their blessings to continue leading their lives in peace. The gods listened to their prayers and were empowered by their offerings, and, in turn, they granted them their boons, allowing the people to thrive without encountering any major problems. That was, until they were met with a deadly plague, the likes of which were beyond the scope of the gods' power to be dealt with. Every last member of the [civilization_name] would fall victim to this plague, including the pharaoh themselves. These poor souls would be laid to rest in their communal tombâ€”a pyramid, carrying with them feelings of having been betrayed by their gods. Overridden with guilt, the gods took it upon themselves to perform the sacred duty of protecting the [civilization_name]'s final resting place as a means of atoning for their failure in protecting their fallen devotees.
    The pyramid was under the divine protection of the sun god Ra, who made daily journeys through the cosmic underworld to keep Apep (the snake god of darkness and chaos) at bay, getting reborn each day to pass the sun through the sky when the time came.
    However, with much of his power having been drained and no more followers to rely on, Ra would eventually meet his permanent demise, plunging the world into darkness and leaving the pyramid vulnerable to Apep. Apep infiltrated the pyramid and defeated Anubis, who was stationed at the pyramid to protect the spirits of the dead. Apep, having full control of the pyramid, brought along his snake minions and condemned the spirits inside with a curse, which awakened them and prevented them from passing on. Filled with their centuries of hate towards their former deities, the now restless spirits roam the floors of the pyramid in a rage. Anubis, having been severely weakened in the fight between him and Apep, lays low inside a secret part of the pyramid, clinging onto a sliver of hope that someone will come and defeat the dreaded god of chaos so that he may use the last of his power to help the cursed spirits pass on to the afterlife.
    Only Ahmose* (the protagonist) was spared of the curse due to being protected by their amulet containing the Eye of Horus, the god of the sky and protector of kings. Ahmose, having forgotten their identity after being reborn, must face the challenges presented to them as they attempt to escape the pyramid and gain the answers to their past.
    *The name Ahmose was chosen at first due to being a gender neutral name in ancient Egyptian society commonly used by both pharaohs and queens. Its meaning, "birth/child of the moon," is a symbolic coincidence with how Ahmose survives with the Eye of Horus (which is his left eye, which is the moon) and brings light to a world of darkness in the place of the sun (due to Ra's death), both literally with their torch and figuratively by defeating Apep and saving the cursed spirits.
    The setting is inspired from the ancient Egyptian civilization and mythology.
